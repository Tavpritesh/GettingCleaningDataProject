GettingCleaningDataProject
==========================

### Introduction

This repository contains the code, codebook and the resultant tidy data submitted for grading under the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Coursera.

The three main components of this repository are
* `run_analysis.R`: The code
* `CodeBook.md`: The codebook describing each step to arrive at the tidy data
* `tidy.csv`: The resultant tidy data

### How the script works

Each step of the script is detailed in the codebook. In short, the script starts right from downloading the data from a specified URL to working through the creation of tables with proper attributes. Finally, statistics are utilized to aggregate the data and write the summarized `tidy-data` to a comma-delimited text file.
